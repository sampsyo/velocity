Velocity
========

This is trying to be a fast, simple [Notational Velocity][nv] for your terminal.

Assumptions:

* You have a big folder full of text files.
* The title of the note is the filename.
* Every note's extension is `.txt`.
* You have an `$EDITOR` you like.

Run `vel`, type a few characters you remember from the note you want, and hit return to open the top match. If there's no match, hitting return will create a new note file instead.
